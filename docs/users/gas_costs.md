# Gas costs
Yield v2 has been built aiming to achieve a minimal gas cost. For reference, these are the gas costs of some common operations.

| Operation                   | Gas Cost | ETH cost at 100 GWei | USD cost at 100 GWei and \$4000 USD/ETH | 
|-----------------------------|------|------------|---------|
| build, post and borrow      | 326K | 0.0326 ETH | \$130.40 |
| repay and remove collateral | 305K | 0.0305 ETH | \$122.00 |
| lend or close lending       | 168K | 0.0168 ETH |  \$67.00 |
| add or remove liquidity     | 320K | 0.0320 ETH | \$128.00 |
|                             |      |            |         |

Please be aware that the Yield v2 transactions are built dynamically for each request, and gas costs might vary by a small amount for each specific situation.
