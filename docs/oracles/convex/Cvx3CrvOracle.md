### min

```solidity
function min(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256)
```

_Returns the smallest of two numbers._

| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| quoteAmount | uint256 | Total amount in terms of quoted token |
| updateTime | uint256 | Time quote was last updated |

### get

```solidity
function get(bytes32 base, bytes32 quote, uint256 baseAmount) external virtual returns (uint256 quoteAmount, uint256 updateTime)
```
