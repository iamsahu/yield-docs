function setApprovals() public
```

Give maximum approval to the pool & convex booster contract to transfer funds from wrapper

### addVault

```solidity
function addVault(bytes12 vaultId) external
```

Adds a vault to the user's vault list

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| vaultId | bytes12 | The id of the vault being added |

### removeVault

```solidity
function removeVault(bytes12 vaultId, address account) public
```

Remove a vault from the user's vault list

### aggregatedAssetsOf

```solidity
function aggregatedAssetsOf(address account) internal view returns (uint256)

| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| account | address | User's address for which balance is requested |

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| [0] | uint256 | User's balance of collateral |

### addRewards

```solidity
function addRewards() public
```

Adds reward tokens by reading the available rewards from the RewardStaking pool

_CRV token is added as a reward by default_

### join

```solidity
function join(address user, uint128 amount) external returns (uint128)
```

Take convex LP token and credit it to the `user` address.

_Before the join is called the vault is already updated, so the balance needs to be adjusted to the previous state for calculating the checkpoint_

### exit

```solidity
function exit(address user, uint128 amount) external returns (uint128)
```

Debit convex LP tokens held by this contract and send them to the `user` address.

_IMPORTANT: Checkpoint needs to be called before calling pour for exit
since the vault is updated before calling exit calling checkpoint here would result in an incorrect calculation_

### _calcRewardIntegral

```solidity
function _calcRewardIntegral(uint256 index, address account, uint256 balance, bool claim) internal
```

Calculates & upgrades the integral for distributing the reward token

| Name | Type | Description |

| account | address | Account for which the CvxIntegral has to be calculated |
| balance | uint256 | Balance of the accounts |
| claim | bool | Whether to claim the calculated rewards |

### _checkpoint

```solidity
function _checkpoint(address account, uint256 delta, bool claim) internal
```

Create a checkpoint for the supplied addresses by updating the reward integrals & claimable reward for them & claims the rewards

_Before the join is called the vault is already updated, so the balance needs to be adjusted to the previous state for calculating the checkpoint_

| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| account | address | The account for which checkpoints have to be calculated |
| delta | uint256 | Amount to be subtracted from depositedBalance while joining |
